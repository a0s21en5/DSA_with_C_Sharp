# Time Complexity

- it is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run. 

- as a function of length of the input.

## Why

- For making better programs.

- Comparision of algorithm.

## Big O Notation (O-notation)
upper bound 

## Theta Notation (Θ-notation)
for avg-case  Complexity

##  Omega Notation (Ω-notation)
upper bound 

## Big O Notation (O-notation)

- Constant Time => 0(1)

- Linear Time => 0(n) 

- Logarithmic Time => 0(log n)

- Quadratic Time => 0(N Square’s)

- Cubic Time => 0(N Cube)

Highest Complexity

| Complexity    |
|---------------|
| O(N!)         |
| O(2^N)        |
| O(N^3)        |
| O(N^2)        |
| O(N log N)    |
| O(N)          |
| O(log N)      |
| O(1)          |

TLE

- 10 to the power 8 Operation Rule

Most if the modern machine can perform 10 to the power 8 Operation / Second
