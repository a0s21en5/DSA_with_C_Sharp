# Time Complexity

- it is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run. 

- as a function of length of the input.

## Why

- For making better programs.

- Comparision of algorithm.

## Big O Notation (O-notation)
upper bound 

## Theta Notation (Î˜-notation)
for avg-case  Complexity

##  Omega Notation (Î©-notation)
upper bound 

- Constant Time => 0(1)

- Linear Time => 0(n) 

- Logarithmic Time => 0(log n)

- Quadratic Time => 0(N Squareâ€™s)

- Cubic Time => 0(N Cube)
