# Time Complexity

- it is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run. 

- as a function of length of the input.

## Why

- For making better programs.

- Comparision of algorithm.

## Big O Notation (O-notation)
upper bound 

## Theta Notation (Θ-notation)
for avg-case  Complexity

##  Omega Notation (Ω-notation)
upper bound
